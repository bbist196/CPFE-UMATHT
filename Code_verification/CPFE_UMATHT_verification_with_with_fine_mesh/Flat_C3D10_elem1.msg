 LARGEST CORRECTION TO DISP.       -7.194E-12   AT NODE          4   DOF  2

          THERE IS ZERO FORCE     EVERYWHERE
 

 ***WARNING: THERE IS ZERO FORCE EVERYWHERE IN THE MODEL BASED ON THE DEFAULT 
             CRITERION. PLEASE CHECK THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE FORCE DURING THE 
             CURRENT ITERATION TO VERIFY THAT THE FORCE IS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE 
             TREATED AS ZERO. IF NOT, PLEASE USE THE SOLUTION CONTROLS TO RESET 
             THE CRITERION FOR ZERO FORCE.
